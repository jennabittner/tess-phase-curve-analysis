# TESS Phase Curve Analysis of Ultra-Hot Jupiters

## Overview
This project analyzes phase curve data of seven ultra-hot Jupiter exoplanets using light curves from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Ultra-hot Jupiters are gas giants with extreme surface temperatures due to their proximity to their host stars. By modeling phase-dependent brightness variations, this project explores atmospheric properties such as heat distribution and wind circulation.

## Planets Studied
Each exoplanet listed below has its own folder containing two Jupyter notebooks: 
- One for data cleaning and preparation
- One for modeling and analysis of the phase curve
- *Note: For KELT-9b, only one notebook exists because the data cleaning was completed by advisor, Anusha Pai Asnodkar, prior to analysis.

- KELT-9 b
- KELT-20 b
- MASCARA-1 b
- TOI-1431 b
- TOI-1518 b
- WASP-76 b
- WASP-12 b

## Tools used
- **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Astropy
- **Light Curve Analysis**: Lightkurve, Astroquery
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks
- **Data Source**: NASA TESS mission

## Author
This project was developed by Jenna Bittner (B.S. in Astrophysics, The Ohio State University), with valuable guidance from Anusha Pai Asnodkar (Graduate Student
in Astronomy) and Dr. Marshall Johnson (Research Senior Associate), both at The Ohio State University.
